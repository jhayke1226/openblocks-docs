An open source, modular alternative of sketchware. Create your own app in android using block programming like scratch!

## What is OpenBlocks?
OpenBlocks is a community-driven modular android application that can create android apps using block programming like scratch. Every components of OpenBlocks are modules, these modules can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, giving users freedom on what they want to do with this app. Create cusomizeable blocks, Custom widgets, Custom manager, Custom project type, Custom everything, Anything you want with it!

### For sketchware users...
OpenBlocks is basically an app that you can mod easily! It's open source, change what you want, do what you want, use what you want!

It's also modular, meaning you can create modules to do something else. For example, I wanted my project to be encrypted, I just download an already existing openblocks module that has this feature and boom! That's it, No need to mod sketchware with pain.

And if you're interested to create a module, we made a documentation for that (well it's not quite finished), check out [openblocks-module-interface](https://github.com/OpenBlocksTeam/openblocks-module-interface), the guide is also there, check out the [documentation](https://docs.openblocks.tk/modules/making-modules/).

> This documentation is open source, if you find some mistakes or want to improve it, check it out on the [github repository](https://github.com/OpenBlocksTeam/openblocks-docs).
